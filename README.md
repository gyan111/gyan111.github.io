* This tool converts Odia language ASCII/Legacy character encoding to Unicode Encoding. There are five types of most used character conversion option available now. 

* Copy the text from the source file and paste it in the left side box. Click on the source character type. If you don't know the type then click on all the buttons. 

* After the successful conversion, the Unicode text will be shown on the right side box. You can copy the whole Unicode text by clicking on the right side button.

* You can clear text by clicking on the clear text button which will appear after each conversion.

* If you want to make a small fix or write the new text you can do so by enabling the keyboard. Find the small keyboard image around the right text box and select the input method you want to type.
